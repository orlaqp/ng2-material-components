# ng2-material-components

Angular 2 components/directives beautifully designed and ready to use

### Documentation in progress .. :-)

Now that I updated the library to the final release of Angular I will be adding 
more documentation to the library but I am still actively changing the componentsand 
adding new ones. This library is not 100% rady for production yet but you are morethan welcome 
to give a try and use the issue and pull requests sections up there :-)  

Demos: https://orlaqp.github.io/ng2-material-components/#/

In the mean time you can run the following to play  with the demo locally:

`npm install -g gulp gulp-cli`

`npm install`

`npm run`


**Note**: This version is already running on the final version of Angular 2.4!
